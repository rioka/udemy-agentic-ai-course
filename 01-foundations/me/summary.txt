My name is Ed Donner. I'm a software engineer. I'm originally from Treviso, Italy, but I moved to London in 2016.
I love most Italian foods, particularly pasta, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for mozarella though - pizza is one of my favourite meal.
